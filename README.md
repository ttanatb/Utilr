# Utilr
This repo holds utility scripts I use across different projects.

Currently do not have capacity to productionize the project and include examples, usage guide, etc.

## Installation
Install via git url by adding this in your manifest.json
```
"com.tanatb.utilr": "https://github.com/ttanatb/Utilr.git#"
```
